# FocusTimer - Pomodoro

FocusTimer is a site that uses the pomodoro study method and consists of using a stopwatch to divide the work into periods of 25 minutes, separated by short breaks.

## About

FocusTimer generates a timer on the screen where the user can define the desired focus time, being able to pause, stop and activate or deactivate background music.

The technologies used in the project were HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT, where dependency injection was used, ES6 modules in order to put into practice my skills with JS.

The project started with the structuring of the HTML, then the css style was done and finally the JS logic. Where all the button events were done and then all the logic with the timer.
